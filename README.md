## WHY

In early January 2020, COVID-19 began to sweep the globe. Shortly therafter, many countries closed their borders and shut down nearly all aspects of society, leaving many people qurantined for an unknown amount of time in their homes. The developers noticed an increase in book and film recommendation requests so they decided to be an app to help fill that void. Enter phase 1 of QuaranREAD: a functional app that suggests books based on user input.
